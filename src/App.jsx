/*This sets up three routes in your application:

The root path "/" renders the Pokedex component (likely your main listing page)
"/pokemon/:id" renders the PokemonDetails component. The ":id" is a URL parameter that can be used to fetch specific Pokemon details
"*" is a catch-all route that displays "Not Found!!" for any undefined routes (404 handling)

Key React Router Concepts:

Routes acts as a container for all your Route definitions
Route components define the mapping between URLs and components
The ":id" parameter in "/pokemon/:id" is dynamic, allowing you to capture values from the URL (e.g., /pokemon/1, /pokemon/25, etc.) */

/*path="/" â†’ This means that when the user visits the root URL (/), the Pokedex component will be rendered.
element={<Pokedex />} â†’ Specifies that the Pokedex component should be displayed when this route is active.

The root URL refers to the base URL of your application, which in your case is:

ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:5173/ (if you're using Vite)*/
